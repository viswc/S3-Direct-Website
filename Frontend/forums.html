                <h2>Bug: Splash screen replays on pressing back button!</h2>
                <p>I am writing to express my concern regarding an ongoing issue with the user experience on our
                    application. Whenever a user presses the back button, the splash screen reappears, disrupting the
                    seamless navigation we aim to provide. This issue has been causing frustration among users, as they
                    expect to be taken back to the previous page they were viewing, not the initial splash screen. This
                    problem not only affects user satisfaction but also potentially impacts our website's usability and
                    retention rates. I urge the technical team to prioritize resolving this bug to enhance the overall
                    functionality and user experience of our platform.</p>

                <h2>Discussion: File copy/paste absolute paths to be given!</h2>
                <p>When users need to copy or move files, they are required to manually type in the absolute path for
                    the destination folder. This process is cumbersome and prone to errors, as it relies on users
                    accurately entering the full path. A more efficient and user-friendly approach would be to implement
                    a pop-up window that allows users to visually browse and select the destination folder. This
                    enhancement would not only streamline the file management process but also significantly reduce the
                    potential for user error and improve the overall user experience.</p>
